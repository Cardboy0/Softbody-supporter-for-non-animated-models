# Softbody-supporter-for-non-animated-models
(Blender) For the people who want to use their non-animated models (i.e. for pictures instead of videos) as softbodies. You can try to do that without any of the stuff this script does and will very likely fail.

This tree is for older versions, for the newest one go to https://github.com/Cardboy0/Softbody-supporter-for-non-animated-models/tree/master instead.
